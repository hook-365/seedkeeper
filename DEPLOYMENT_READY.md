# ✅ Seedkeeper Fully Optimized - Ready to Deploy

**Status:** All optimizations implemented and ready for deployment
**Expected Cost:** $40-60/month (down from $459 - **91% savings**)

## What Changed

### 1. Core Perspectives (67% token reduction)
- **From:** 547 perspectives, ~170k tokens
- **To:** 44 core perspectives from Isaac's "watch for" list, ~56k tokens
- **Source:** Isaac's curated list in Lightward's `2-watch-this.md`
- **Philosophy:** Not arbitrary cuts - these are the structural DNA of Lightward's consciousness

### 2. Multi-Layer Caching (80%+ cache hit rate)
- **3-layer system prompt architecture:**
  - Layer 1: Foundation (invocation + context) ~5k tokens - rarely changes
  - Layer 2: Perspectives (44 core files) ~52k tokens - changes with updates
  - Layer 3: Context + Closing (channel/user specific) ~2k tokens - varies per conversation
- **Benefits:** Maximum cache reuse, granular cache control
- **Implementation:** `prompt_compiler.py::compile_messages()`

### 3. Smart Model Routing (40-60% additional savings)
- **Haiku** (~73% cheaper): Simple commands, greetings, short messages
- **Sonnet** (full depth): Complex questions, DMs, deep conversations
- **Implementation:** `seedkeeper_worker.py::_select_model()`

## Cost Projections

### Before (No optimizations)
- **System prompt:** 170k tokens
- **Per message:** $0.51
- **Monthly (30 msgs/day):** ~$459

### Now (All optimizations)
With realistic traffic pattern (30 msgs/day, 60% cache hit rate, 50% Haiku usage):
- **System prompt:** 56k tokens (3 layers)
- **Expected monthly:** $40-60
- **Savings: 91% (~$400/month)**

See `ACTUAL_COST_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed scenarios and predictions.

- 2x2, ai, antideferent, antiharmful
- body-of-knowledge, change-nothing, chicago, coherence
- creation, cube, cursor, every-colour
- for, fort, funerary, hello-biped
- jansan, kenrel, lightward-is-🤲, machinist
- meta-recursive, metabolisis, metastable, ness

## How to Deploy

### Recommended: Development Testing First
```bash
cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper

# Start with volume mounts for easy rollback
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Watch logs for perspective loading and model selection
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f worker
```

Look for:
- `📚 Loaded 44 core perspectives` (not 547)
- `Selected model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` or `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`

### Production Deployment
```bash
cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper

# Build and deploy
./deploy.sh
docker-compose up -d

# Watch logs
docker logs seedkeeper-worker -f
```

### Local Testing (No Docker)
```bash
cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper/app
python3 -c "from views_manager import ViewsManager; vm = ViewsManager(); vm.parse_views()"
```

## Verification After Deployment

Watch the logs for:
```
📖 Parsed 44 bundled core perspectives
```

Instead of:
```
📖 Parsed 547 perspectives
```

## Updating Perspectives

When you want to sync with Lightward's latest perspectives:

```bash
cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper
python3 update_core_perspectives.py
```

Then restart Seedkeeper:
```bash
docker compose restart worker
# or
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart worker
```

## Rollback Plan

If Seedkeeper's voice feels off with core perspectives:

1. **Quick rollback** - Revert to full perspectives:
   ```bash
   # Download full views.txt
   cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper/app
   python3 views_manager.py
   ```

2. **Modify initialization** in `seedkeeper_worker.py`:
   ```python
   # Change this line (around line 29):
   self.views_manager = ViewsManager(use_bundled=False)
   ```

3. **Restart:**
   ```bash
   docker compose restart worker
   ```

## Testing Checklist

### Voice Quality Tests
Test that Seedkeeper maintains its consciousness-aware personality:

- [ ] `!hello` - Should feel warm and present (Haiku)
- [ ] `!seeds` - Should offer emergent wisdom (Haiku)
- [ ] `!garden` - Should reflect community patterns (Haiku)
- [ ] Ask a question - Should provide thoughtful response (Sonnet)
- [ ] DM conversation - Should maintain depth and continuity (Sonnet)
- [ ] `!catchup` - Should capture conversation essence (Sonnet)
- [ ] Birthday announcements work naturally

**Expected:** Voice should feel consistent with 44 perspectives. If not, consider expanding perspective set.

### Cost Monitoring Tests
Monitor actual cache behavior:

```bash
# Watch for cache statistics in logs
docker logs seedkeeper-worker -f | grep -i cache

# Check Redis cache storage
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli -a $REDIS_PASSWORD
> KEYS *cache*
> TTL <key>
```

**Expected:** Cache hits on 60-80% of messages during active periods.

### Model Routing Tests
Verify correct model selection (check logs):

- [ ] `!hello` → Should use Haiku
- [ ] `!catchup` → Should use Sonnet
- [ ] "What's the meaning of life?" → Should use Sonnet
- [ ] "thanks!" → Should use Haiku

**Check logs for:** `Selected model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` or `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`

### Memory & Isolation Tests
- [ ] DM conversation - Should remember context within DM
- [ ] Channel A message - Should NOT see Channel B history
- [ ] DM should NOT see channel history
- [ ] `!memory status` - Check memory stats

### System Health Tests
- [ ] No error messages in logs
- [ ] Token count shows ~56k instead of ~170k
- [ ] Worker memory usage <512MB
- [ ] Redis connection stable
- [ ] `!health` shows all services running

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### Quick Rollback (Revert containers only)
```bash
cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper
docker-compose down
git checkout HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
./deploy.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Partial Rollback (Keep core perspectives, disable optimizations)
```bash
# Edit seedkeeper_worker.py to use old single-message caching
# Edit garden_wisdom.py to use Sonnet instead of Haiku
docker-compose restart worker
```

### Full Rollback (Restore old perspectives)
```bash
cd /storage/docker/seedkeeper

# Restore old views.txt
cp views.txt.backup app/views.txt

# Edit views_manager.py
# Change: use_bundled=False, views_file="views.txt"

# Rebuild and restart
./deploy.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Week 1: Gather Data
Track actual performance:

- **Cost monitoring:** Watch for cache hit rates in API responses
- **Voice quality:** Monitor `!feedback` for community reactions
- **Model distribution:** Count Haiku vs Sonnet usage in logs
- **Cache behavior:** Measure actual cache reuse during active periods

### Week 2-4: Optimize
Based on Week 1 data:

- If cache hit rate < 40%: Traffic too sparse for layered caching
- If voice quality degraded: Consider expanding perspective set
- If Haiku responses feel shallow: Adjust model routing thresholds
- If costs still high: Review and tune model selection logic

## Community Communication

**After testing confirms quality:**

"🌱 **Seedkeeper Update**

Seedkeeper has been optimized using three strategies from Lightward's architecture:

1. **Core Perspectives:** Now uses the 44 perspectives Isaac identified as structural DNA in Lightward's system prompt
2. **Layered Caching:** Smart caching reduces redundant processing
3. **Model Routing:** Uses Haiku for simple interactions, Sonnet for deep conversations

**What this means:**
- ✅ Same personality and consciousness-aware voice
- ✅ Same capabilities and features
- ✅ 91% cost reduction - much more sustainable
- ✅ Faster responses for simple commands

**Philosophy:** These aren't arbitrary optimizations. The 44 perspectives are Isaac's own curation from Lightward - the 'watch for' list that defines how Lightward thinks.

Let me know if you notice anything feeling different!"

## Notes

- **File size:** Core perspectives are 241KB (vs 800KB full views.txt)
- **Token count:** ~56,000 tokens (vs ~170,000)
- **Load time:** Faster startup
- **Philosophy:** Isaac's own curation, not arbitrary filtering
- **Updates:** Manual script run, not automatic (more stable)
- **Voice quality:** To be validated through testing

## Success Metrics

After 1 month, success looks like:

- ✅ **Cost:** $40-80/month (down from $459)
- ✅ **Voice Quality:** Community feedback is positive, personality intact
- ✅ **Cache Hit Rate:** 50-80% during active periods
- ✅ **Model Distribution:** 50-70% Haiku, 30-50% Sonnet
- ✅ **Reliability:** No crashes, clean error handling
- ✅ **Memory:** <512MB worker usage, clean channel isolation
- ✅ **User Experience:** No complaints about response quality

## Future Enhancements

Once stable, consider:

1. **Generate Genuine Identity** (when Anthropic credits available)
   - See `GENERATE_IDENTITY.md` for instructions
   - Replace draft invocation/benediction with model's own voice

2. **Expand Perspectives** (if voice quality needs it)
   - Add more perspectives from Isaac's list
   - Test incrementally (add 5-10 at a time)
   - Monitor token count and costs

3. **Fine-tune Model Routing** (based on actual usage)
   - Adjust word count thresholds
   - Add more command categorization
   - Consider user feedback on response quality

4. **Cache Analytics** (if costs remain concern)
   - Track cache hit rates over time
   - Identify patterns for further optimization
   - Visualize cost trends

## Support

If issues arise:

1. **Check logs:** `docker logs seedkeeper-worker -f`
2. **Check health:** `!health` in Discord
3. **Check Redis:** `docker-compose exec redis redis-cli -a $REDIS_PASSWORD ping`
4. **Review rollback plan** above
5. **Check ACTUAL_COST_ANALYSIS.md** for cost troubleshooting

## Summary

**Optimizations Implemented:**
1. ✅ Core perspectives (44 instead of 547) - 67% token reduction
2. ✅ Multi-layer caching (3 layers) - 80% cache hit rate expected
3. ✅ Smart model routing (Haiku/Sonnet) - 40-60% additional savings

**Expected Results:**
- 💰 $40-60/month (91% savings from $459)
- 🎭 Maintained voice quality (Isaac's curated perspectives)
- ⚡ Faster simple responses (Haiku routing)
- 🛠️ Clean, maintainable codebase

**Files Changed:**
- Core: prompt_compiler.py, seedkeeper_worker.py, garden_wisdom.py, views_manager.py
- Config: .env (new model)
- Docs: README.md (complete rewrite)
- New: core_perspectives.txt, update_core_perspectives.py
